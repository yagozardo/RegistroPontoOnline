## Getting Started
This document describes how to configure the system deploy and how to open it in any IDE for any modifications that involve configuring the project.
### Prerequisites
To deploy the system, you must install:
* Tomcat 7+ (to deploy in production).
* JDK8+.
* MySQL
* Any IDE (The IDE used in this project was Netbeans).

### Running in DEV mode

#### Configuring the Database
* All the DB configuration can be found and configured in a file called **datasource.properties**, if you don't have this file, you can create by your own.

* By default, a properties file in a specific directory on your computer:
	* If you choosed to keep the default configuration, you must create a directory named **pontu** with **datasource file** in it.
```
WINDOWS: C:\\Pontu\\datasource.properties
LINUX DIST.: /usr/local/pontu/datasource.properties
```
  * To change the default directory open the file data **dataSource.java** in *src/main/java/com/br/pontu/config*. Change the directory path on the operating system you want, follow the example below:
 
**WINDOWS**
```java
      
 if(so.equalsIgnoreCase("windows 10") || so.equalsIgnoreCase("windows 7")) {
					
	  arquivo = new FileInputStream("C:\\Pontu\\datasource.properties");
}
```
**LINUX**
```java
 if (so.equalsIgnoreCase("linux")) {

	   arquivo = new FileInputStream("/usr/local/pontu/datasource.properties");
}
```
* You also can change the datasouce file to any name you want here!
